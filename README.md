This is the repository for the Community-Contributed InSAR Product Archive at UNAVCO.

The repository will contain converter scripts for popular InSAR processing software (i.e. ISCE, GMTSAR...)
to create data products that can be uploaded to the archive.  Eventually, software for reading the data
products and converting to other formats (i.e. GeoTIFF, netCDF...) will be made available.  Since this is
a community-contributed product archive, submissions and suggestions are welcome.  Send a pull request or 
create an issue in this repo.

Feedback can also be sent to baker@unavco.org
